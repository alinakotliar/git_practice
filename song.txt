A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
